				<h3>Monday, February 23rd, 2015. </h3>

				<p>Today we continued on learning about arrays and watched a few videos to help us better on learning arrays. We didn't have that much time do to the fact that its a short day on Monday but anyways, it's pretty interesting how many things you can put inside an array.</p>
			</div>

			<div id= "journalwrapper">
				<h3>Tuesday, February 24th, 2015.</h3>

				<p>We continued learning on how arrays work and its slowly starting to be more interesting to me. It's still a little complicated but thats because I just need more practice on it. So i'll probably get it down soon enough.</p>
			</div>

			<div id= "journalwrapper">
				<h3>Monday, March 2nd, 2015.</h3>

				<p>Today we did a cheat sheet on arrays and it is gonna be pretty helpful to have that. I am now able to understand more things that i didnt know and have something to look back on and help me.</p>
			</div>	

			<div id="journalwrapper">
				<h3>Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015.</h3>

				<p>Today we finished another glue-in and it was on how to take away or add things to the end of an array or the beginning of an array. It is a little complicated to use but I feel like it could come in handy so lets see if we end up using it.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="journalwrapper">
				<h3>Monday, March 9th, 2015</h3>

				<p>I was super late today and did not attend class but I just want to add this in my journal. Sorry Mr. Jamieson. I'll wake up early and be in class next time.</p>

				<p>We started on Bootstrap and checked out websites. It was very interesting to me how creative people make websites. It was pretty cool to see all those different websites and how they are.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="journalwrapper">
				<h3>Thursday, April 16th, 2015</h3>
				<p>We were asked to update our web journals. We have been doing Bootstrap as a mini project and it seems fun to play with. Hopefully it will continue to be fun as well. I checked out these 3 websites 				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.lexus-int.com">Lexus-int.com</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.timeshift165.com">Timeshift165.com</a></li>
