            <h3>February 24, 2015</h3>
              <p>This week we are learning about how to make basic scripts in JavaScript.  Today I worked on the array project that is exposed to ask the user what their favorites foods are, then display their answers in an alert.  It can get kind of confusing with all the different perenthesis and brackets, but I am enjoying learning how to actually make my webpages funtional

            <h3>March 2, 2015</h3>
              <p>Today we filled out a cheat sheet for JavaScript terms. We learned how to use them and what each of them does. We also did a quick check on where we are at and what work we stil need to get done.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>March 3, 2015</h3>
              <p>Today we learned about how to make for loops and how to make scripts that rotate through different variables.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>March 17, 2015</h3>
              <p>We are continuing to work on our first JavaScipt project in class today and this week. It's pretty hard getting the html, CSS, and the JavaScript to all work together. I am starting to understand all the individual parts of the for loop.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>March 31, 2015</h3>
              <p>Today we learned how to use if then and if else loops. We did a small project that helped us understand how to use them.

            <hr>

            <h3>April 4, 2015</h3>
              <p>Today I did some more work on my rock, paper, scissors game. My game is mostly finished, except for the win conditions. I actually really enjoy using the if then or if else statements.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>April 16, 2015</h3>
              <p>We are looking at the designs of other popular websites, so that we can learn how to make our own websites look a bit more modern. I think both of the sites I looked at had very well put together navigation bars and I enjoyed how each site had different things happen as you scrolled down.  There wasn't really anything that stood out as being particularly bad about either site, but sometimes it felt like there was a bit too much going on at once on the screen, and I couldn't focus on the actual content of the page. Here are some of the sites that I thought were pretty well put together.</p>

              <h3>April 20, 2015</h3>
                <p>Today I did some work on my Grid Practice project.  I really like how putting together pages using Bootstrap works, because it is easy to organize and understand.  I also really enjoy how most of the styling is actually already done for you and you just have to know the code to access it.</p>

              <h3>April 21, 2015</h3>
                <p>Today we signed up for Github accounts and took surveys about how the class is going.  I also got a lot more work done on my Grid Project today.  The only thing I have left to do is make the website scale down to window size and fix the formatting on my images.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3>May 4, 2015</h3>
                <p>Today we are uploading our Grid Practice project to GitHub and learning more about how to organize a site using the Bootstrap grid.  This week I am hoping to compile all my major projects into one site and begin organzing it using Bootstrap.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3>May 7, 2015</h3>
                <p>Today is another work day for our projects. I am planning on finishing up the Bootstrap Grid on my site, so I can start putting the content back into the pages.  We are also working on organizing our files into Github, so that we can access and share them on different computers.</p>

              <h3>May 12, 2015</h3>
                <p>Today we practiced how to make forms on our sites, using HTML and JavaScript.  I am also continuing to work on my final project.</p>

              <h3>May 18, 2015</h3>
                <p>Still working on my final project, trying to get the navigation bar perfect.  I am also trying to correctly format the images on my main introduction page.  The last thing I have to do after that is applying Bootstrap to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
