				<p>Today I had to get my journal all set up so I couldn't really get anything done along with the fact that we have like 45 minutes to do this. But yeah I will catch up with everything tomorrow when we actually have time to do stuff.</p>

			<p>Today we got a glue in that is basically a cheat sheet and we learned more about how to be better students I guess? You gave a beautiful speech on the whales in nigeria and how they are looting all of the buoy's carrying the precious nutella. but I mean it is monday so..</p>

			<p>Today we were watching some videos and just working on our moodle checklists.They are going just great you know all that writing and listening and just staring blankly at a screen for an hour.</p>
		</div>	

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Thursday Mar 5, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today we worked with some loops and dove into them a bit. Oh! you also said that we are starting a big assignment on monday so screw the system. I don't think I'm gonna catch onto JavaScript as well as you'd want me to.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Monday Mar 9, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today we got to do everything we've been doing this WHOLE ENTIRE year and it isn't as bad as you'd think. Although I hate JS so far I don't think it's too much to freak out about.</p>

			<h1>Tuesday Mar 10, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today you were gone Mr. Jamieson, we kind of just chilled and did work as we moved along. I still kind of don't get it all but I'm working hard towards it man, I hate this by the way. I wish I could get the motivation to actually enjoy this because it just isn't even catching my attention in class seriously bro.</p>

			<p>Today we kept working on our JS projects, I feel like I'm getting nowhere with this project but I'll keep trucking along and trying to get it as we progress more and more with this.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Monday Mar 15, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today we did more of the JS projects but it is monday so I really honestly didn't do anything except look at longboards online and check into my moodle to make sure my ass isn't falling behind.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Tuesday Mar 17, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today we did more of our projects and you mentioned something to us about bootstrap. We spent a lot of time in the front of the class listening to you talk but that's good. You teach pretty good lessons if you ask me.</p>

			<h1>Thursday Apr 2, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today we registered for the dual credit PCC thingy and I did that with ease and fully successful outcomes. You spoke to us about more stuff we need and that we need to keep up with all of our booty stuff. I then did nothing because I'm a very lazy person and I will do it all on monday I promise.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Monday Apr 6, 2015</h1>
			<p>We just looked at moodle and just established ourselves for both the week ahead and the RPS game that seems to be the final project. I am swimming through it with ease and I'm sort of enjoying it so far so A+ on the not being boring part Jamieson! Good Job :)</p>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Tuesday Apr 7, 2015</h1>
			<p>We're working on our projects, web journals, and basically anything we need to keep going on this crazy train. I spoke to you about math and you basically met with the seniors and told us what we need to pass this class this year from this point on.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Thursday Apr 9, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today I honestly don't even know what we did. I didn't log anything for anything and I think it was just a lazy day that I did absolutely nothing in this class I'm sorry jamieson!!!!!</p>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Monday Apr 13, 2015</h1>

			<h1>Tuesday Apr 14, 2015</h1>
			<p>We are looking at sites today, seeing what we like from websites made by real web designers and it's very cool to see what we can do with our fingertips and some electricity running to this stupid blasted machine living on this desk with a bunch of holes and a fan.</p>

			<h1>Thursday Apr 16, 2015</h1>
			<p>The three websites I looked into yesterday were the following: <a href="http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/local/promotion/bydesign/">www.ana.co.jp</a> ...I loved this site because although it was just a website about japanese airplanes it was very fluid and just plain beautiful all throughout. It flowed with ease and it provided the perfect information in the most perfect way possible. the second was <a href="http://www.onedollarlesson.com/">onedollarlesson.com</a> ...I absolutely adored this site. It had amazing graphics throughout the whole site and there's so much in it. You can tell that this site took a very long time to make with how in deoth it was, I give it an A+. the final one was <a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">kurokawawonderland.jp</a> ...I believe this site is talking about a specific place in Japan. It is very awesome although it seems like they put a lot into things that aren't even a huge part of the site overall. There is what looks like a gyroscope next to the 360 viewer on the left hand of the screen but it doesnt do a single thing. It looks cool but it distracts quite honestly.</p>

			<h1>Monday Apr 20, 2015</h1>
			<p>I am now convinced I'm going crazy. It's monday the 20th a.k.a. 4/20!!!!!!! and I am not focused on anything today except after school so I honestly did nothing except update my web journal and do whatever things you wanted me to do because why not?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Tuesday Apr 21, 2015</h1>
			<p>We did the GitHub stuff today and we had to do some surveys for whatever you needed us to do. We also watched you dink around on the big screen just showing us how to do something in like 6 minutes or less on how to do some shit with some thing from mars. I don't know man my hand hurts and I'm really hungry so I think I'll just go die.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Thursday Apr 23, 2015</h1>
			<p>I did nothing today except look for jobs and sort out the GitHub signup stuff for your peace of mind. I would do coding things but that's really boring and it'd take me like 30 minutes to finish the project anyway.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Monday Apr 27, 2015</h1>
			<p>I  mostly did nothing today again. I did however work on my RPS game and all that's left is the bootstrap stuff which isn't even sort of hard. I find it hard to do things during a 40 minute period. They should really stop doing the monday thing it's really pissing me off and I only have like 6 weeks of school left.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Tuesday Apr 28, 2015</h1>
			<p>I found out today that you weren't informed of my not caring of people opnions and feelings. You can't fix my mouth and I'm not scared or even slightly intimidated by you. I really enjoy your company and your teachings and I'm sure we would be great friends outside of school but in a "proffesional environment" you really get on my nerves with the whole image thing. If I cared I wouldn't swear and call you sir, so what does that mean Jamieson? I don't care about any/all schools and all of their stupid rules on how to act.</p>
		</div>		

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Thursday Apr 30, 2015</h1>
			<p>I  mostly did nothing today, I believe I might have finished adding the finishing bootstrap to my rock paper scissors game. Bootstrap is actually really easy along with the rest of the stuff in this class but WHATEVER JAMIESON.</p>

			<h1>Monday May 4, 2015</h1>
			<p>I  did try and upload my crap to github but I think it's not really working cause the little icon keeps popping up and down to notify me that mac's suck, everything that apple produces lasts little to no time before maintainence is needed. I don't want to keep working on anything cause it sucks.</p>

		<div class="col-xs-2 col-sm-6 col-md-10" id="margarin">	
			<h1>Tuesday May 5, 2015</h1>
			<p>So today I think I might have finished up all my RPS stuff as far as the initial set up. I am gonna work on the design a little more but other than that I believe I did nothing. I enjoy the weather this week and it is amazing because it is warm and no wind!!!!! yay.</p>

			<h1>Thursday May 7, 2015</h1>
			<p>Nothing ensued today simply because there is a shortage of sunglasses at the dollar tree probably cause the local nipple cover factories owner is having an affair with the owner of dollar tree. I am very caught up in this issue because well, I don't know. I am however also looking up a way for me to space travel in a watermelon. Don't do drugs kids.</p>

			<h1>Monday May 11, 2015</h1>
			<p>I  am done with basically everything today, there wasn't much to be said about the whole class as a whole but I mean it wasn't THAT bad. Oh other than the stupid css for all my projects and oh crap I forgot I need to bootstrap my web journal.... I hate you.</p>

			<h1>Thursday May 14, 2015</h1>
			<p>I  am currently working on bootstrapping my web journal, I already finished doing it to my RPS game so I'm not worried about that. You didn't give much of a lesson as far as like teaching something new you are just very worried about those who don't know how to keep their attention on these death machines you call computers!!!! I need to watch that noodle webcast apparently though, today's gonna be good!!</p>

			<p>Today I decided that becoming a nepal monk is also not my calling simply because they cannot keep bearded vultures as pets and that makes me sad. :( I also continued to work on the wretched workings on what I call the Kraken. Or a.k.a. THE HORRIBLE, THE TERRIBLE, BOOOOOOOOOTTTTSSSTTTRRAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP</p>

			<h1>Tuesday May 19, 2015</h1>
			<p>Today I got a lesson on what a DOM is and it seems like it will be the death of me if I were ever to learn about it, I don't think I will make much more progress with coding sites cause this is just a lot of brain power that I just don't have enough physical energy for. I am not even sure what I want to dive head in with so I highly doubt it'll be coding websites for weird fat guys.</p>

			<p>Today I recieved the award for most things brought on by a sneeze, I cleaned my house, watered my dogs, and did three backflips while frying eggs on a 250 degree pan! I am very accomplished in my computer class too though, I am almost done with my project so that will continue to be updated as we go along. :)</p>

			<p>I  am currently wondering about how much thrust it takes for the banana to peel itself out. Cause usually you have to pump up the air tubes and reslease the valves that can induce the peeling but I know that if enough thrusters are added to the back of it, there will be greatness among us who believe in this science. IT WILL WORK I TELL YOU.</p>

			<p>I  did try a little bit of wasabi in my fruit loops this morning and that was actually not that bad of an idea, I mean other than the projectile vomiting all over my boss's neice's dog walker's friend's pet snail's previous owner's daughter. But she should be fine, I just have to pay some or most of the money it'll take to buy her new eyeballs, who knew that stomach acid, fruit loops, and wasabi could be explosive if thrown up!</p>

			<p>Last class, it was great jamieson and I hope you learned something from me, like how to deal with douchey teenage students who don't care! Anyways I'm happy you were the one to teach me the beauty of these wretched machines. I hope to see you again and I might use you as a reference to further my bounds as a random brown kid. Have a good summer man.</p>
