				Ahmed's Web Journal

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>February 23rd</h4>
			<p>Arrays are a series of variables, prompts, alerts, etc. Today covered how to use arrays in Java and we started the Arrays Challenge. They aren't too complicated but they can definitely be tricky if you dont pay close attention.</p>
		</div>

	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>March 2nd</h4>
			<p>Today we made a cheat sheet for Javascript and continued work on the Array Challenge. I still need to finish the rainbow challenge since I missed a day, but that shouldn't be too difficult</p>
		</div>

	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>March 3rd</h4>
			<p>Still catching up. I'm still getting a hang of integrating Javascript with everything we've learned so far.</p>
		</div>

	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>March 5th</h4>
			<p>Worked in groups today, we were assigned a Java loop project and a lot of us didn't really understand how to do it. So we went over it as a class and we learned some valuable information. JS is slightly less confusing now.</p>
		</div>
	<br>
		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>March 9th</h4>
			<p>We started our new comprehensive Javascript project. I have some other things I need to finish first. </p>
		</div>

	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>March 16th</h4>
			<p>Objective: Work on collaborating, ideas for Javascript Projects</p>
			<p>Agenda</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drill</li>
				<li>Moodle</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>We are continuing to work on our project before the break begins, I'll probably keep working on it over the break too since its all on my PC.</p>
		</div>

	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>April 3rd</h4>
			<p>Finished my JS project and submitted. Now onto this Rock Paper Scissors project and whatever our next project may be</p>
		</div>
	<br>

		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>April 16th</h4>
			<p>We looked over some amazing webesites and looked at how Bootstrap aids their much more complex, and asthetically pleasing designs.</p>
			<p>Three websites in particular that I included in my notebook were:
				<ul>
					<li>Spacecraftforall</li>
					<li>Memphis Minimal Wordpress</li>
					<li>and Brooklyn United</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
		</div>
	<br>
		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>May 18th</h4>
			<p>We are in the final stretch headed toward the end of the year. This week I aim to finish up my final project and have it ready to go by Friday or Saturday at the latest.</p>
		</div>
	<br>


		<div id="journalWrapper">
			<h4>June 2nd (last day ever)</h4>
			<p>My site is all done, although it is sort of janky in certain areas in my opinion I think it is atleast a semi-accurate reflection of my coding skills and how I've grown over the year. Pardon the terrible rant on my homepage, it was late at night when I wrote that. I've really enjoyed this class this year and do not regret taking it one bit. I wish I could've been younger so I could take AP Computer Science when they finally offer it at Franklin in the upcoming years.</p>
