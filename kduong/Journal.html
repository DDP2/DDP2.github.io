			<h2>Mr. Khoi's daily journal</h2>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, February 23rd 2015</h3>


			<p> Today is a short period, but we've gotten through some interesting lessons by using moodle. Completing the Array challenge was a success.</p>

		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, February 24 2015</h3>

			<p> Learning about Array made coding class more interesting. I was able to interact with the webstie i created and the functions of Array was capable of asking questions when refreshed. I'm looking forward to learn more.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, March 2 2015</h3>

			<p> Though today was only lasted 45 minutes, i was able to understand functions about Variables and console.log. I'll get to work tomorrow to explore more options of it.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, March 3 2015</h3> 

			<p> Today i was able to learn new javascript codes such as unshift, shift, push and pop and their functions. These varibles helped me to simplify my work.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Thursday, March 5 2015</h3>

			<p> The group challenge taught me how to work better with JavaScript. I got to learn about working with Loops and While loops.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, March 10 2015</h3>

			<p> I wasn't able to finish the project because of some problems with the Javascript. Being unable to do it made me realize how much more i should pay attention in class. I want to learn more about Array and Javascript. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, April 6 2015</h3>

			<p> I was introduced to more of the Javascripts functions. Variables can do great things such as creating a  rock paper scissors game and even the "ask and answer" activity.</p>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, April 7 2015</h3>

			<p> Even though I thought I was done with most of my work, I was assigned in doing the rockpaper scissors game. I actually enjoy doing this project. It helped me to get a better understanding varibles and its functions. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, April 13 2015</h3>

			<p> I had time to finish up my Javascript project 1. During the process, I learned that there isn't just one way to have reach the goal of the project. With the help of my friend, I was able to know that creating a list could be fun.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, April 14 2015</h3>

			<p> We got to interact with different websites and their features. The first website that I found interesting was <a href="http://www.lamborghini.com/en/home/">Lamborghini</a> , this car brand had updated their website so that consumers can have access to all of the great car deals and very thorough informations about them, they've chosen the right color schemes and themes for the website. One of my least favorite sites was <a href="http://www.nba.com/">NBA</a> , although they've included updated news and features, the site was boring used the same color schemes, blue, red and white. My favorite website has got to be <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> , I love the idea of a blog consisting of infinite scrolling, Tumblr doesn't just have great contents and resources, you could create your own theme base on who you are as a person, a blog in which you could be yourself. </p>

			<h3>Tuesday, April 21 2015</h3>

			<p> After we got done with the survey, I was able to work on my journal and my Bootstrap project. Although i still couldn't get the images to be straight in line, i'm going to work on it today. </p>
		</div>


		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, April 28 2015</h3>

			<p> GitHub was confusing but with the help of my friend Jacob, I was able finish the task. I still don't know what GitHub can help me with but hopefully my question will be answered next class period. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, May 5 2015</h3>

			<p>I was able to upload my Grid Practice onto GitHub. Although it seems like someone had clicked on it and viewed it, I think the purpose of that was to fix any errors in the codes.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, May 11 2015</h3>

			<p>Today Mr.Jamieson introduced us to our final project, it consists of everything we've learned the past semester. This is going to be my chance of bumming my grade up to a higher A in the class, all i got to do is to finish this project a week before the due date.</p>
		</div>


		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, May 12 2015</h3>

			<p>I was introduced to different kind of forms and their functions. Mr.Jamieson showed me how to delete my GitHub data and cloned it again in the desktop. Today was productive</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, May 18 2015</h3>

			<p>Our final project will be about what we've learned all year, game, bootstrap, grid practice and our journal. Its kind of a burden because i have other finals as well, but i think i'll do fine on this one. The senior has a better chance of turning it in on time because our due date is on the last day of school.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Tuesday, May 26 2015</h3>

			<p>I had done a lot for my final project today, I was able to start with styling the project, making the menu buttons compattible with each other. One of the hard parts of the project is that you basically have to start everything from scratch and add new stuff. I feel good today though, I want to finish the project within this week.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Thursday, May 28 2015</h3>

			<p>Mr Jamieson wasn't here but I was very focused on my final project, I've finished more than half of it. My friend Lucky helped me fix my errors and I am now working on forms.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="journalWrapper">

			<h3>Monday, June 1 2015</h3>

			<p>I'm almost finish with my Final Project, all i have to do now is to complete the Form section. With that being said, decorating the website should be easy and short.</p>
