      <p>Today 3/4/15, I learned how to build a For loop in JavaScript and constructed several questions that pop up as a prompt on my web page. Together in class we learned the difference between For loops and While loops, for the purpose of saving time and reducing redundancey.</p>

      <p>4/16/15 Last class we have downloaded bootstrap and began a short project with that. We also looked at a few sites that had already been created using bootstrap. <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.savetheglobe.org/">Site #1</a> , had a fun interactive design with a pop out menu, but there was very little content. The next site I went to, <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.neelia-joaillerie.com/collection-pearl/"> site #2</a> , had a introduction and moved according to the mouse. One thing I didn't like about it was that it had no navigation bar. The last site I looked at was the most impressive of all of them, <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.cadamuro.it/">site #3</a> , it was visually enthralling, and had all its information in a neatly ordered, translucent, drop down menu. It had multiple language options and interactive pictures that weren't too overwhelming.</p>

      <p>5/28/15. This is my last day to style and upload my final project site. It has matched all the requirements. There is a user input form inside the navigation bar that prints what is written onto the page inside the nav bar. There is also a button form and input form at the bottom of home page. There are five pictures that are styled and paragraphs about the author. Also all of the links work and this web journal is attached to the site along with my game page.</p>
