	<p>The Arabs were the first, not only to cultivate coffee but also to begin its trade.  By the fifteenth century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the sixteenth century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria and Turkey. Although the Arabs began the trade of the coffee bean it is said that Kaldi, a goat herder from the Ethiopian highlands first discovered the energizing effect of coffee bean because of his goats. He would often notice that the goats would be more energized and awake after nibbling the coffee trees.</p>
