		  <p>Today 3/4/15, I learned how to build a For loop in JavaScript and constructed several questions that pop up as a prompt on my web page. Together in class we learned the difference between For loops and While loops, for the purpose of saving time and reducing redundancey.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4">

		  <p>4/16/15 Last class we have downloaded bootstrap and began a short project with that. We also looked at a few sites that had already been created using bootstrap. <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.savetheglobe.org/">Site #1</a> , had a fun interactive design with a pop out menu, but there was very little content. The next site I went to, <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.neelia-joaillerie.com/collection-pearl/"> site #2</a> , had a introduction and moved according to the mouse. One thing I didn't like about it was that it had no navigation bar. The last site I looked at was the most impressive of all of them, <a id="webLinks" href="http://www.cadamuro.it/">site #3</a> , it was visually enthralling, and had all its information in a neatly ordered, translucent, drop down menu. It had multiple language options and interactive pictures that weren't too overwhelming.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4">
		  <p>Today is 4/20/15. In class I am working on my grid practice project using bootstrap. My page is mostly complete, I must finish adjusting my images, add two more paragraphs, and the last step is to make it align correctly for mobile use.</p>
