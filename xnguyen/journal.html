			<p>We finally moved into learning JavaScript today. Last class we were finishing up projects, working in CodeCademy, and reading about the history of the internet. Here are three things I learned about today.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>String</b>- A series of text that is shown on the web. It can be numbers and letters.</li>
				<li><b>Variable</b>- Numbers or strings that can serve multiple functions, it has to be named first, it cannot start with a number.</li>
				<li><b>Number</b>- Basically a number, can be used with operations. It is important to variables.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Summary:</b> Today, I learned about the basic structure of Javascript through watching a video. I learned that you can't just name a variable what you want, there are specific names that are not allowed in variables. I also learned about the importance of numbers and how it is useful in variables.</p>

			<p>Today, we are starting to make our own Javascript page, Mr. Jaminson will start the first program, and we are to do the same. We are also making a webjournal by HTML and CSS. We are using it to record our data.</p>

			<p>We are also learning about console.log, and how the text inside the console doesn't actually appear on the webpage. The text or number or string that appears in the console log is actually only visible when you press F12, or open up developer's tools.</p>
			<p><b>Summary:</b> Today, I learned how to start a javascript program and how to save it as a javascript. I also learned about console log, and it's purpose and function.</p>

		<div class="notetitle">
			<h1>Tuesday, February 24, 2015</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="notepara">
			<p> Today, we are going to learn all about arrays. They are defined like variables, but in order to define an array, you have to do this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Array</b>- var my_array = ["one", "two", "three"]</li>
				<li><b>Variable</b>- var my_variable = "one, two, three"</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Summary:</b> Today, we learned about the basics of arrays, they are kind of like variables. But they are classified more like a list. They are defined like variables, but they use a "[]" mark instead of a normal variable. We also learned how to put the variables on the html page. And joining the variables with normal strings.</p>

		<div class="notetitle">
			<h1>Thursday, February 26, 2015</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="notepara">
			<p>Javascript has 6 different types of values. These serve as multiple functions to the script. These are the 6 types: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Object</b>- Not primitive. Anything that isn't a string, number, boolean, undefined, or null.</li>
				<li><b>String</b>- A collection of characters. Can be defined by using the "" or '' symbol.</li>
				<li><b>Number</b>- Used for calculations, can be integers or decimals. NaN means "not a number."</li>
				<li><b>Boolean</b>- They are ture or false statements, we use it for logic.</li>
				<li><b>Undefined</b>- They are non-values, they are given to variables with no assigned value.</li>
				<li><b>Null</b>- This is a place holder, if you were to put it in an equation. the null will be ignored.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Summary:</b> Today, I learned about the 6 main functions in Javascript. I have experienced with objects, strings, and numbers, but I have never known about null, booleans, and undefined until now. I didn't know that those functions below is very important. For example, you need booleans to have logic, or how we need to use undefined for a variable with no value.</p>

			<h1>Monday, March 2, 2015</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="notepara">
			<p>Today, we are going to learn the basic commands to strings and numbers in Javascript. These are the main commands for strings and numbers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>var message = ""</b>- Sets a variable to the string between the "" sign.</li>
				<li><b>prompt("")</b>- Pops up a message the user can answer.</li>
				<li><b>alert("")</b>- Pops up a message.</li>
				<li><b>var message = prompt("")</b>- The user's answer will be stored in the variable.</li>
				<li><b>message.length</b>- Shows a number that determines how long the variable is. Spaces do count.</li>
				<li><b>message.toUpperCase();</b>- Makes all the characters uppercase.</li>
				<li><b>message.toLowerCase();</b>- Makes all the characters lowercase.</li>
				<li><b>Math.ceil</b>- Rounds the number to the higher integer.</li>
				<li><b>Math.floor</b>- Rounds the number to the lower integer.</li>
				<li><b>Math.random</b>- Returns a number between 0-1.</li>
				<li><b>var my_array = []</b>- Creates an array.</li>
				<li><b>(my_array[0])</b>- An example of selecting a certain variable in an array.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Summary:</b> Today, I learned about the basic commands in strings and numbers, I never knew there were so many commands for them. I also learned how to sellect certain variables in arrays.</p>

			<p>FOR LOOP and WHILE LOOP</p>
			<p><b>FOR- </b>For loop is used to repeat an action, it is a container that holds the data of the variable, the true or false statements, and the end function that runs after the middle function runs.</p>
			<p><b>WHILE- </b>While loop functions exactly like the for loop, the only difference is that the while loop lacks the variable and the end function.</p>
			<p><b>Summary: </b>Today, I learned about for loops and while loops, and their differences. I learned that each loop has its own uses.S</p>

			<p>Today, We are introducing the if else statements.</p>
			<br>
			<p>-If else statements are used when the main functions are false. They are defined by "else if". If the main functions are false, the script will go over this block to see of the if else function is true. If not, it'll continue until there are no more if else statements in the block, or if it lands on the else statement.</p>
			<p>-The else statement is ran by the script if no if else statement is ran. The else statement is like the if else, but it is always true.
			<p><b>Summary: </b>Today, I learned the difference between the else and if else statements, and how they're important to games like rock paper scissors.</p>

			<p>TO UPPER CASE AND TO LOWER CASE</p>
			<p>-The toUpperCase and the toLowerCase functions are important for prompts because it'll make the all the strings turn to upper or lower case. This will make the answer run even if the user types with a specific combonation of upper and lower case letters.</p>
			<p><b>Summary: </b>Today, we started working at our first is else project, it is a very simple project where you have to put a prompt that asks a question. Then, depending on your answer, will print out something on HTML.</p>
