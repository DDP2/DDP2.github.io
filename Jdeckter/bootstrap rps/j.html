            <p class="jourNal">We were introduced to JavaScript, more in-depth. Learned about variables and their basic uses such as they're keywords/"storage". How you can't have start a variable with a number or how you can use $ or _ in a keyword, but not @ or other such symbols. Strings are used for words/commands and need "" or '' to work. If you start with one, the closing must be the same. All I really learned about numbers was that they had to do with the calculations within JavaScript.</p>

Learned a in-depth understanding of each component to a for loop and how to link it to an HTML page. Was also introduced to a while loop that does basically the same thing a for loop can.</p>

            <p class="jourNal"> Did drill that helped us understand JavaScript that applies to our projects. Didn't get too much done with the short amount of time in class, but decided to strip what I had done with my Rock, Paper, Scissors and just follow Mr. Jamieson's moodle instructions.

            <p class="jourNal"> I continued working on my game, now trying to add elements to it that made it more complex. Spent most of the period looking up 'How To Tutorials' on google in order to figure out how to make it work code-wise. Didn't get too far until the end of class when I found a piece of code that did what I wanted. Will apply it to everything I want next class.</p>

            <p class="jourNal"> I really worked on making my game more complext this period-looking things up and applying. I finally got my game in the 'A' grade zone, but had a slight error with positioning. Ran out of time, will have to finish it another time, but otherwise finished my project!

            <p class="jourNal"> We started looking at bootstrap as a class and looked at some sites. My favorite was this one: <a href="http://www.teamgeek.co.za/">Team Geek!</a>. I liked their interactive title and loading icon. Two other websites I liked were: <a href="http://www.repostage.com/">Repostage!</a> and <a href="https://mirumee.com/">Mirumee!</a>. I loved the color schemes and feel of those websites.  We took such elements and made a list-hoping to use them in the future. Started a grid project that I will need to finish next class.</p>

            <p class="jourNal"> I messed around with the grid porject and eventually finished. Still not 100% positive about it-memory wise, but understand the basics. Worked on Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have not solved my positioning issue. Will need to continue next class on it.</p>

            <p class="jourNal"> I continued working on my Rock, Paper, Scissors project most the period until Jamieson told me just to start Bootstrap using my Rock, Paper, Scissors. Got a small demo on what to do and started it, but did not finish. Need to add my css and hope all links well! Continue on it tomorrow.</p>

I understood for the most part, however, not positive if I can do it on my own for my project. Only time will tell.

Today, worked on the bio pages the most, with a small part of changing my Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Still haven't added my forms or added the web journal...will have to do it another time.
