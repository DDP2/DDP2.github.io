      <p id="text1">  You wake up propped against a hard bricked wall.  The room has about a inch of water collected on the floor from the dripping ceiling.  In front of you there are steps leading up and  a torch guides the way up.  To your left there is a door way and to your left again another, the former has a wooden doorway, the latter is bare.  </p>

      <p id="text1">    You try to remember what has happened to you, why you are here.  For the life of you you can't even remember your own name.  You check your clothing for some sort of identification.  You're dressed in dirty damp rags, there is one pocket sewn to the inside of the pants, which contains some cheese and bread, about a meals food.  Tucked in the back of your pants is a short cooks knife.
