      <p id="text1">  Walking through the wooden doorway you walk up some steps, this room is dry.   The floor is rather warm and dark.  You begin to feel sleepy.  In the middle of the room is a giant barrel.  The ceiling goes long as to fit the barrel.  A distillery?  You think to yourself.  Though where there is no smell of beer.  However a stench of animal waste fills the air.   Even stranger there are the voices again coming from the barrel.  Walking around the barrel to the other side of the room you find a ladder.  </p>
