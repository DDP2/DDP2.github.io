      <p id="text1">You climb up the ladder, skipping every other step.  The barrel is open at the top, the-SWEET CHRIST ITS MONKIES!  They pile over each other hooking arms and forming ladders as others climb to add themselves to the chain.  They screech and bark amongst each other and once one or two notice you, they all do.  They stare blankly at you, then all at once begin the screeching and barking, now at you, working quickly now to escape the barrel.  </p>
