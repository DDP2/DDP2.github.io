      <p id="text1">    You try to remember what has happened to you, why you are here.  For the life of you you can't even remember your own name.  You check your clothing for some sort of identification.  You're dressed in a dirty Space Utility uniform.  Tucked in the back of your pants is a short light Phaser. <br> The machine tells you to pick a destination.  Mars, Terra, and Luna are all possible destinations.
